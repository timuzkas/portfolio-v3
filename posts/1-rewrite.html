        <p>this is the new page. as much as i love nuxt, vite and such stuff, it is slow,
        and i think not necessary for a portfolio.</p>

        <p>the old website had heavy animations, unsupported webgl filters, and zero mobile
        layout. i got tired of explaining to friends why the site looked broken on their
        phones so...</p>

        <p>lately i was experimenting with hosting websites with c++, my tokenizer and html
        stack. so instead of making the website optimized and responsive, i rewrote it lol.
        i think it looks more mature, i also really like Instrument Serif, sorry for abusing
        it lol :?</p>

        <p>now portfolio is hosted on github, so its always accessible, even if i break my
        vps for the third time in a month lol...</p>

        <p>now i also have a rss feed, and this post is mostly a test for it)</p>

		<p> i even made whole list of elements and css things to make it look good and have a good foundation to make blogs ( maybe ), we'll see...</p>
